				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We love OpenProject and we work with it every day.

<p><span id="more-4240"></span></p>
<p>Did you ever get stuck asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I quickly update my work packages without opening every detailed view?</li>
<li>How can I display my work packages in a timeline?</li>
<li>How do I add new members to my projects?</li>
</ul>
<p>We have collected the answers to these and many other questions about OpenProject in the <a title="User Guides" href="https://www.openproject.org/help/user-guides/">User Guides</a>. From the first steps to adapting system settings, this is where you will find all the answers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can browse through the <a title="FAQ" href="https://www.openproject.org/help/faq/">Frequently Asked Questions</a>Â for a quick solution to your question.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>OpenProject 4.0.5 has been released which contains several bug fixes. We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installations.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4122"></span></p>
<div class="wiki">
<p>The following bugs have been fixed in the core:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sorting by a version in the work package list, the result was not shown but an unclear error message displayed (<a class="issue work_package status-22 priority-3 closed" title="Sorting by version leads to 500 in experimental API (&quot;Unable to retrieve query from URL&quot;) (closed)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17928">#17928</a>).</li>
<li>Clicking on the project name in a timeline let to &#8220;Page not found&#8221; (<a class="issue work_package status-22 priority-3 closed" title="[Regression] Page not found when clicking on project link in timeline (NaN in link) (closed)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17819">#17819</a>).</li>
<li>The &#8220;Close&#8221; icon of modals was cut off (<a class="issue work_package status-22 priority-2 closed" title="[Regression] Close icon of modals is cut off (closed)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17818">#17818</a>).</li>
<li>Dates in the work package list were sometimes not displayed properly (<a class="issue work_package status-22 priority-2 closed" title="Single bad translation on work package table. (closed)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17043">#17043</a>). Thanks a lot to <a class="external" href="https://community.openproject.org/users/35400">Mike Lewis</a> for reporting this error!</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the work package export via CSV is working properly again (<a class="issue work_package status-22 priority-2 closed" title="CSV Export is fixed (closed)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/16813">#16813</a>). Before, only the default columns were displayed in the exported file.<br />
A big thanks goes to <a class="external" href="https://github.com/TribesTom">Thomas Tribolet</a> for fixing this bug!</p>
<p>Finally, syntax highlighting is working again (e.g. in the wiki and repository):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SyntaxHighlighting.png" rel='colorbox'><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4056" src="https://www.openproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SyntaxHighlighting.png" alt="SyntaxHighlighting" width="267" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>In the Translations plugin an error was fixed which caused translations in the work package list not to be displayed properly (<a class="issue work_package status-22 priority-2 closed" title="Missing js files added (closed)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17944">#17944</a>).<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We received many requests from users who wanted to use the simple installation procedure provided by packager while also using the plugins.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today, we released a new packaged installation alternative for OpenProject.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p title="OpenProject released on Bitnami"><strong>Bitnami Â released OpenProject installers for Windows, OS X and Linux, as well as virtual machines today.Â </strong></p>
<p><strong> This provides an additional (one-click) installation option for OpenProject besides the <a class="external" href="https://www.openproject.org/download/packaged-installation/">installation via packager</a> and the <a class="external" href="https://www.openproject.org/download/manual-installation/">manual installation</a>.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4117"></span><br />
The released OpenProject version is <a class="external" href="https://www.openproject.org/download/release-notes/openproject-4-0-4/">OpenProject 4.0.4</a> and contains not only the core but also <a class="external" href="https://www.openproject.org/download/install-plugins/">multiple plugins</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/openproject"><img src="https://community.openproject.org/attachments/4831/download" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Especially the Windows installer provides an additional environment in which OpenProject can be used.</p>
<p>OpenProject <a class="external" href="https://community.openproject.org/news/76-openproject-wins-bitnami-contest">won the Bitnami contest in September</a> by having the most users vote for OpenProject out of a large number of open source applications.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>In the last weeks we have been working on a new concept for the work package detail view (fullscreen).</strong></p>
<p><strong> Our goal is to have a new well structured and responsive layout, so that all information and functions are neatly arranged on one page.</strong></p>
<p><strong> We spent a lot of time to improve the whole user experience in order to make OpenProject more intuitive and easier to use. Many UI elements are designed in a much cleaner and new flat way.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4127"></span></p>
<p>As you can see in the attached drafts, we will provide two different layouts for small and big desktop displays. The responsiveness of Openproject is a big deal for us<br />
and will be part of all future developments.</p>
<p><strong>List of new features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>new structured layout / more space between contents</li>
<li>improved toolbar with a view-switcher button</li>
<li>added watch/unwatch button to the toolbar</li>
<li>full accessible inplace-editing</li>
<li>uploaded images will displayed as clickable thumbnails</li>
<li>the status will be emphasized by adding colors</li>
<li>show / hide function for the attributes list</li>
</ul>
<p>The new work package view (<a class="issue work_package status-3 priority-2" title="Fullscreen view for work packages detail pane (specified)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/16364">#16364</a>) is scheduled after the completion of the inplace edit for the work package split screen (<a class="issue work_package status-3 priority-2" title="Work package inplace edit (specified)" href="https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/13701">#13701</a>).</p>
<p>Please let us know what you think of it. Your feedback is much appreciated.</p>
